<h2><b><i>About me and my project</b></i> <br></h2>
I am Nikhil Pawar, a Graduate Student at The University Of Texas at Arlington pursuing MS in Computer Science.
As a part of my Google Summer of Code 2017 internship at Apache Software Foundation, I have been working on 'Apache Fineract Credit Bureau Integration phase 2'.
Currently, there is no feature for reporting credit history in Fineract. This module will give ability to clients to check the credit history of the loan applicant and consequently mitigate the risk to bad debt.
Along with checking, this Module would also allow client organizations to report to credit bureaus. 
		
<h3> As a part of Apache Fineract credit Bureau Integration phase 2 following modules were developed: <br> <br> </h3>

<h3> <b> 1) <u>Family Members module:  </b></u> &nbsp &nbsp  Status: Completed <br> </h3>
<i> This module was primarily designed and developed to support Credit buerau module.<br>
Family members modules enables users to store details of family members in Fineract.<br>
These details will be plugged in to credit bureau enquiry, so that credit bureau can rightly identitfy client's records. <br><br>
