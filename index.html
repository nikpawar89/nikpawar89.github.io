<h2><b><i>About me and my project</b></i> <br></h2>
I am Nikhil Pawar, a Graduate Student at The University Of Texas at Arlington pursuing MS in Computer Science.
As a part of my Google Summer of Code 2016 internship at Mifos Initiative, I have been working on 'Mifos Credit Bureau Integration'.
Currently, there is no feature for reporting credit history in Mifos. This module will give ability to clients to check the credit history of the loan applicant and consequently mitigate the risk to bad debt.
Along with checking, this Module would also allow client organizations to report to credit bureaus. 
This feature of Credit reporting and credit checking  is optional and may be incorporated based on the requirements of the client organization <br><br>

<h3> Mifos credit Bureau Integration is a vast project and has been divided into sub-modules as follows: <br> <br> </h3>

<h3> <b> 1) <u>Address Module.  </b></u> &nbsp &nbsp  Status: Completed <br> <br> </h3>
<i> This module gives the ability to the user to add address for client entity in Mifos.<br>
It is generic enough to extend to other modules. In order to use Credit Bureau, address Module should be enabled.<br>
Further details can be found at<a href=https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOSX/Address> more..</a> <br><br>
